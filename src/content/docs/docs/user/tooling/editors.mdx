title: IDE Extensions
---

A language is much more enjoyable with some great editor support. At the moment, we have syntax highlighting extensions
for VSCode and Emacs, and you can use
[Hylo's TextMate grammar](https://github.com/hylo-lang/vscode-hylo/blob/main/syntaxes/hylo.tmLanguage.json) to add support for
other editors.

<Aside title="Help wanted!">
    The [language server](https://github.com/hylo-lang/hylo-language-server) is work in progress, currently not yet
    available within these extensions. Contact us on <a href={slackLink}>Slack</a> if you want to join its development!

## Visual Studio Code Extension
Search for the extension named "Hylo" in the VSCode marketplace:
![Hylo extension in VSCode](./assets/vscode.png)

This extension also adds code execution support, so if you want to set that up, check out [its documentation](https://github.com/hylo-lang/vscode-hylo/).

## Emacs: Hylo mode
We have a basic fork of Swift mode for Emacs in [this repository](https://github.com/hylo-lang/hylo-mode). We have no
guarantees whether this works, but after the language server is functional, we are planning to add official support to
many editors, including Emacs.
