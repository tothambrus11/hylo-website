## Values and Culture

### 1. Curiosity and Research
Explore SOTA ideas, techniques, learn from latest research and push the boundaries of current knowledge. Question
assumptions, experiment boldly, and value learning. If challenged with an established problem or task, talk with experts
in that field. (TODO rephrase)

### 2. Collaboration over Competition

We believe that working together instead of against our competitors leads to better outcomes for everyone. Making
languages is not a zero-sum game. While developing Hylo, we learn from Swift, Rust, C++, Odin among many others,
and we contribute back with bug reports, patches, research findings, and authoring libraries that we developed either
for research purposes or for the development of the compiler. By sharing early and
helping each other, we can receive feedback and improve our work quicker than if we worked in isolation.
It's best if we keep the world's success > community success > personal success. Generosity will circle back and result
in advancing the latter ones.

### 3. Inclusivity and Respect

Making a language successful requires diverse perspectives and experiences. Domain experts tend to have blind spots in
areas outside their expertise, thus it's crucial to listen to a wide range of voices both during language design and
community building with respect. We strive to create an environment where everyone feels welcome and valued, regardless
of their technical background. See also our [code of conduct](/docs/contributing/code-of-conduct/).
