title: Our Strategy
layout: ../layouts/Page.astro
---

Desires:
- Solid core language and a working compiler
- Great UX for developer tooling
  - Diagnosis:
    - Compilers can be very slow
    - Lagging IDEs are frustrating
    - Crashing LSPs are frustrating
    - Lack of proper debugging value inspection -> slower debugging
    -
  - Strategic Objectives:
    - Reasonably fast compile time from scratch (for a medium-sized project, 2-3 minutes)
    - Fast incremental compile time (under 8 seconds)
    - Responsive IDE experience (under 200ms for common operations - todo clarify)
    - Good code quality of the compiler and tools.
  - Actions
    - testing, code review, benchmarking, profiling, CI/CD
    - explore SOTA LSP and debugger testing techniques, make new ones if needed

## Guiding Policies and Strategic Actions

### 1. Curiosity and Research
We push the boundaries of the state-of-the-art by being curious and research-driven. We achieve this by studying the
industry's existing approaches and relevant academic literature, engaging with domain experts of our problems, and
experimenting with new ideas. When

### 2. Collaboration over Competition

We see language development as a shared effort, not a zero-sum game. We learn from Swift, Rust, C++, and
Odin among others, and we give back through blog posts, bug reports, patches, research findings, and libraries we build along the way. By sharing
our work early and helping others, we get feedback, connections, and make faster progress than we would alone. We value the
world's success first, the community's second, and personal success third - generosity ultimately strengthens all
of them.

### 3. Evolving Practical Trade-offs

We don't believe a successful systems programming language can exist without trade-offs. With novel approaches, clever
engineering and a good set of trade-offs, we can gain significant advantages from existing languages. When making
trade-offs in language or compiler design, we follow these principles:
