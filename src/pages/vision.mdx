TODO: Write a mission statement. See whether this needs to be the same as the strategy page.

The strategy (whether internal or shared here), <a href="https://guidebook.theopensourceway.org/getting-started/building-a-strategy#recording-your-strategy">
should include</a> the following points:

 - A concise (and precise) description of your project and the problem(s) it solves for users
 - A description of how your project solves that problem in a way other projects don't
 - A clear understanding of why an open source approach to this project is beneficial (partly answered by [community values](/community))
 - A sense of the users, developers, and maintainers contributing to the project (answered by [community values](/community)
 - A list of activities in which you'll engage to grow awareness of your project and lower barriers to participating in it (partly answered by [community values](/community)
