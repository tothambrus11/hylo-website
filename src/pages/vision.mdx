    TODO: Write a mission statement. See whether this needs to be the same as the strategy page.

    The strategy (whether internal or shared here), <a href="https://guidebook.theopensourceway.org/getting-started/building-a-strategy#recording-your-strategy">
    should include</a> the following points:

    <ul>
        <li>A concise (and precise) description of your project and the problem(s) it solves for users</li>
        <li>A description of how your project solves that problem in a way other projects don't</li>
        <li>A clear understanding of why an open source approach to this project is beneficial</li>
        <li>A sense of the users, developers, and maintainers contributing to the project</li>
        <li>A list of activities in which you'll engage to grow awareness of your project and lower barriers to
            participating in it
        </li>
    </ul>
